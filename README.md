I am really poor and I really can't afford a license. I just want to get rid of the annoying dialog on every login.

## Features

* Works for any version >=5 (we've tested this from 5.3 to 6.0 without any changes in the code)
* Non-intrusive, no changes to any system file, persists between system updates
* Comes with standard Debian package, easy to manage and automate
* You can uninstall at any time (you might need to wait a week for the cache to be invalidated)

## Installation

* Go to [release](https://github.com/Jamesits/pve-fake-subscription/releases/latest) to download the latest release
* Run `dpkg -i pve-fake-subscription_*.deb` on every Proxmox VE node
